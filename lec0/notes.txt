Prof. Scott
Lecture date:  1/21/21

* examples from CS102  ->  hello world, input output, other basics 

Brief discussion of stream operators, preprocessor, namespaces

You should also read Chapters 2 and 3 (if you were not planning on
already) to familiarize yourself with C++ syntax after class.

NOTE!!!  main function must always exist, just like in C!


Additional examples to show similarities with C/help with prelab:
-------------------------

-> add.cc :    variables, input output, sums
-> stat.cpp:   arrays, for loops, brief into to C++ strings
-> digits.cc:  while loops


Associated reading from text:
-------------------------

Review Figures 1.6-1.11 and associated text just in case, especially
if you have not had Fundamentals I.
